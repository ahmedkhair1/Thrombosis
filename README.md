# Thrombosis
Analyzing Thrombosis data to unravel insights

# Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure and patterns of the dataset. The analysis will be performed both visually and non-visually to address initial questions and formulate hypotheses for the given dataset.

This project involves:
- Data Ingestion
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Producing High-quality reports

# Deliverables
- EDA Technical Exploration Notebook (EDA.html)
- Non-technical Report (Results.html)

# Dependencies
The analysis was conducted using Python and relevant data analysis libraries. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed before running the code.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the EDA technical exploration notebook (EDA.html) to review the detailed analysis.
4. Review the Results Summary Report (Results.html) for a concise presentation of the key findings.
